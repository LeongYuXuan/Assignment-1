# Assignment-1
## Repository for Assignment 1 for Interactive Development
Github Page Link: https://leongyuxuan.github.io/Assignment-1/
## Project Name
### 1 Page Personal Portfolio
This is a website meant to be viewed by possible employers when job hunting. Having the person's portfolio freely viewable on the internet is not only convinient, it can also display the skills of the person, if the website was built from scratch. 

## Design Process
Due to poor time management, the late start to the assignment, along with the other projects, I decided that I should try have all the contents into one page. No Projects would also be shown as a result...

The "users" would be the Job Hunter and the Employer.
As a/ the Job Hunter, I would want to easily display my skills and projects to future employers, so I wouldbe able to secure a job easier.

As the Employer, I would like to be able to acquire a profile a possible worker's attributes (e.g skills, educational history), so it owuld be easier to determine if an individual has the qualifications to be hired.
The wireframes would be included in the image file, under "wireframes".

## Features (To be added):
(Wow, sudden change)

## Features (added):
* Heading Section
* Educational History Section
* Skills Section
* Contact Section, for people with inquiries to send a quick email to the individual.
* Additional contact info section
* Flex Boxes
* Media inquiries to make sure website visuals do not break


## Tech Used:
* Google (for searching how todo that etc...)
* HTML Boilerplate (Visual Studio) https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sidthesloth.html5-boilerplate
* CSS Normaliser by necolas on github https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
* W3C HTML validator https://validator.w3.org/
* W3C CSS "Jigsaw" validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
## Testing Stories:
Mostly just re-adjusting window size.

## Test: Downsizing window size from 1280.
Observations: Media Inquiries sucessfuly prevent website from looking odd until ~200px width. Going smaller prevented people from seeing text content on the left of the screen. Hopefully very few have a device that small.

## Test: Upsixing window from 1280px
Observations: Website looks normal when viewed at my default laptop window size (~1480px). Beyond that, the profiles for both the educational history and skills kept growing and thus started looking weird. Website elements stop growing at ~2173 px and remained constant in size while the body kept going.

To do: Fix the overgrowing of the profiles

Result: Far too late to modify. I have lost too much marks for it to be worth it since this was being done 2 days past the deadline

## Test: HTML validation via W3C
Observations: Doctype error was a patiular error. Almost thought the entire page was broken after I tried fixing the doctype thing. It was fixed after adding "flex-direction: column". Gave me a big scare.

## Test: Fixing CSS validation via W3C "Jigsaw"
Observation: Only 1 error, it felt great.
