# Assignment-1
Repository for Assignment 1 for Interactive Development

Project Name: 1 Page Personal Portfolio

This is a website meant to be viewed by possible employers when job hunting. Having the person's portfolio freely viewable on the internet is not only convinient, it can also display the skills of the person, if the website was built from scratch. 

Design Process

Due to poor time management, the late start to the assignment, along with the other projects, I decided that I should try have all the contents into one page. No Projects would also be shown as a result...
The "users" would be the Job Hunter and the Employer.
As a/ the Job Hunter, I would want to easily display my skills and projects to future employers, so I wouldbe able to secure a job easier.
As the Employer, I would like to be able to acquire a profile a possible worker's attributes (e.g skills, educational history), so it owuld be easier to determine if an individual has the qualifications to be hired.
The wireframes would be included in the image file, under "wireframes".
